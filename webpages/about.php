    <h5>Prevention of COVID-19</h5>
        <p>The best way to prevent infection from COVID-19 is to avoid exposure to the virus. The virus spreads mainly from person-to-person through close contact (within about 2 Gaz). When an infected person coughs, sneezes or talks, respiratory droplets are produced. Other people can catch COVID-19â€™ if they breathe in these droplets. In addition, people may come to be infected if they touch surfaces, such as doorknobs or tables on which infected droplets have landed, and then touch their mouth, nose or eyes. COVID-19 also spreads by asymptomatic people.</p>
